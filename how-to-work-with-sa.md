# Background
The goal of the below is to provide the most efficient and successful SA experience possible. Giving an SA a "soft ball" assures that the SA can hit the ball out of the park. The below are rules that we use to assure that we are at our best and able to get as many technical wins as possible. Obviously there are exceptions to all of these rules. These are the rules that start the discussion as we decide what expections should be used and where 


#  Travel for Individual Contributors
 * **25-30% Travel** Expected travel is 25-30% unless told differently (Surges in travel are understandable as long as the cumulative stays around 25-30%)
 * **In territory** Travel should only be expected by the assigned SA to the territory. Other SA's can volunteer but there is no expectation that they attend nor expect quota relief for those deals

# SA relationship with Support
After there is a purchase, Support will provide Tier 1/2 Support. Initial help should come from Support. If we know that Support will not support the question, that is when the SA should be considered

# Overlay Solution Architects
 * **SA's request Overlay Support** All requests for overlay time from AE/SA's running a territory should go through the territories SA, not the AE. This includes overlays in the region and corporate level overlays
 * **Work on this one** DoD Overlays are connected to RVP's in the same way as an SA is connected to AE. As in, the two of them build plans together to define the actions of the SA for that region

# Customer Meeting Expections
 * **Prep meeting and post meeting** The best value of an SA comes when there is a prep and post meeting for the call. This allows the SA to fully understand their role and how to be successful. It is understandable that all calls cannot have prep/post calls, the higher priority calls should all have prep/post calls
 *  * **Shadow Notes Mandatory** This is specific to internally created meetings (customer did not create the meeting) At least 24 hours before the meeting, Shadow Notes are to be placed on the calendar at the same timeslot as the meeting. If these shadow notes do not exist prior to the meeting then the SA is not required to attend the meeting. 
 * **Shadow Note Specs** Shadow Notes will have at least the following information:
    **add a shadow notes template**
    - Expected audience (specifically if they are technical or executive etc)
    - Goal of the meeting
    - What defines this as a successful meeting to you
    - What demo is to be presented
    - Any key pieces of information to keep in mind while presenting
 * **Default is: SA's don't share Elastic 101 slides** AE's present the fundamental slide deck for the 101 presentations. The SA can decide when and if they present slides
 * **Custom Demo's take more time** If an uncommon, custom demo is to be presented, the SA is allowed to define the amount of time necessary to create that demo. The size/chance of the deal and quantity of custom demo's requested will affect the level of effort, if any, that will be considered to create the demo. The scope is heavily driven by the SA to avoid scope creep. It is not expected to be presented until that time is completed
 * **SAs for Stage 2+ meeting** Almost all Stage 1 meetings do not need an SA. SA's can add value to Stage 2 meeting when and if the customer has already requested or is prepared to hear a specific technical topic. In general, very few SDR led meetings will need an SA.
 * **Overlapping meetings with different AE's** 

# Proof of Value (PoV)
 * **When and how to use PoVs** Several prep meetings and informal approvals must be setup in advance of a PoV to acheive the below. These rules come from years of experience seeing failed PoVs due to not preparing the customer in advance of the effort. If the below items cannot be met but a pilot needs to be built, then it is expected that the customer will perform a customer-led trial instead of a PoV. Custom demos/POVs should ONLY be performed on the criteria that canâ€™t be shown via **existing demos or customer references**
* **List of PoV Specs** The following should exist for a successful and efficient PoV
    - A list of success criteria created with the customer that needs to be built in the PoV (the SA will assist in reducing this list down to a quickly delivered PoV)
    - Verbal commitment from the economic buyer that, if proven, the above list of criteria will be enough from a technical perspective would be enough for a purchase
    - Customer assigns someone to assist the PoV effort. This is key, it needs to be a very capable engineer with the correct permissions/accesses to fulfill the task (not the engineer that has free time)
    - Paid pilots should be the preferred option for any custom POC/POV/demo (less OOTB features, maybe for the 2nd/3rd deal) that will take more than X specified amount of time. Paid Pilots should engage Services
* **Reduce customization** SA's will work hard to make the PoV as "cookie cutter" as possible while assuring the Technical Win will be met. This may require extra effort by all parties to reduce the spec's of the PoV. It will allow the PoV to be more successful. It will also assure the SA can be used in more accounts
