# Background
The goal of the below is to provide the most efficient and successful SA experience possible. Giving an SA a "soft ball" assures that the SA can hit the ball out of the park. The below are rules that we use to assure that we are at our best and able to get as many technical wins as possible. Obviously there are exceptions to all of these rules. These are the rules that start the discussion as we decide what expections should be used and where 


#  Travel for Individual Contributors
 * **25-30% Travel** Expected travel is 25-30% unless told differently (Surges in travel are understandable as long as the cumulative stays around 25-30%)
 * **In territory** Travel should only be expected by the assigned SA to the territory. Other SA's can volunteer but there is no expectation that they attend nor expect quota relief for those deals

# SA relationship with Support
* **Support provides Tier 1/2 Support** After there is a purchase, Support will provide Tier 1/2 Support. If we know that Support will not support the question, that is when the SA should be considered. All other help should come from Support

# Overlay Solution Architects
 * **SA's request Overlay Support** All requests for overlay time from AE/SA's running a territory should go through the territories SA, not the AE. This includes overlays in the region and corporate level overlays
 * **Work on this one** DoD Overlays are connected to RVP's in the same way as an SA is connected to AE. As in, the two of them build plans together to define the actions of the SA for that region

# Customer Meeting Expections
 * **Prep meeting and post meeting** The best value of an SA comes when there is a prep and post meeting for the call. This allows the SA to fully understand their role and how to be successful. It is understandable that all calls cannot have prep/post calls, the higher priority calls should all have prep/post calls
 * **Shadow Notes Mandatory** This is specific to internally created meetings (customer did not create the meeting) At least 24 hours before the meeting, Shadow Notes are to be placed on the calendar at the same timeslot as the meeting. If these shadow notes do not exist prior to the meeting then the SA is not required to attend the meeting. 
 * **Shadow Note Specs** Shadow Notes will have at least the following information:
    **add a shadow notes template**
    - Expected audience (specifically if they are technical or executive etc)
    - Goal of the meeting
    - What defines this as a successful meeting to you
    - What demo is to be presented
    - Any key pieces of information to keep in mind while presenting
 * **SA's generally don't share Elastic 101 slides** AE's present the fundamental slide deck for the 101 presentations. The SA can decide when and if they present slides. It is expected that the SA will provide the demo.
 * **Custom Demo's take more time** If an uncommon, custom demo is to be presented, the SA is allowed to define the amount of time necessary to create that demo. The size/chance of the deal and quantity of all custom demo's requested will affect the level of effort, if any, that will be considered to create the demo. The scope is heavily driven by the SA to avoid scope creep. The custom demo is not expected to be presented in any form until that time is completed
 * **SAs for Stage 2+ meeting** Almost all Stage 1 meetings do not need an SA. SA's can add value to Stage 2 meeting with the correct prep. This prep is when and the customer has already requested to hear a specific technical topic. In general, very few SDR led meetings will need an SA.
 * **Multiple meetings setup at the same time with different AE's** The SA is allowed to weight the conflict based on:
   - which meeting was setup correctly first
   - how strategic the SA's involvement in each meeting would be
   - where each opp is in the sales cycle, and
   - the account importance overall.
All things being relatively equal, then the SA should ask you for coverage support in whatever form for the other meeting. 
The SA will work quickly to assure both AE's can prepare for the changes based on this conflict

# Proof of Value (PoV)
 * **When and how to use PoVs** PoV's are both high touch and high value. For this reason we want to make sure they are as efficient as possible. To do this, the below "PoV Specs" are setup to help everyone achieve as successful of a PoV as possible.
Several prep meetings and informal approvals must be setup in advance of a PoV to acheive the below. These rules come from years of experience seeing failed PoVs due to not preparing the customer in advance of the effort. If the below items cannot be met but a pilot needs to be built, then it is expected that the customer will perform a customer-led trial instead of a PoV. If these "PoV Specs" cannot be met, custom demos/POVs should be performed instead
* **List of PoV Specs** The following should exist for a successful and efficient PoV
    - A list of success criteria created with the customer that needs to be built in the PoV (the SA will assist in reducing this list down to a quickly delivered PoV)
    - Verbal commitment from the economic buyer that, if proven, the above list of criteria will be enough from a technical perspective would be enough for a purchase
    - Customer assigns someone to assist the PoV effort. This is key, it needs to be a very capable engineer with the correct permissions/accesses to fulfill the task (not the engineer that has free time)
    - Paid pilots should be the preferred option for any custom POC/POV/demo (less OOTB features, maybe for the 2nd/3rd deal) that will take more than X specified amount of time. Paid Pilots should engage Services
    -  Success criteria should be filtered to ONLY the items that CANNOT be met via **existing demos or customer references**. Customer References should be used as much as possible as most architectures have been built somewhere else in the DoD. 
* **Reduce customization** SA's will work hard to make the PoV as "cookie cutter" as possible while assuring the Technical Win will be met. This may require extra effort by all parties to reduce the spec's of the PoV. It will allow the PoV to be more successful. It will also assure the SA can be used in more accounts
