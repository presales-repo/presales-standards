# Note:
It is better to be natural than perform everything below. This is not a blueprint for success, these are suggestions that we know will work

## Goal of a demo:
Not to show every feature. It is to excite the customer for the next sales event (PoC, larger meeting etc)

## Prep:
- [ ] For this customer do you have a STRONG ANSWER to *"Why Buy Anything?"*
- [ ] For this customer do you have a STRONG ANSWER to *"Why Buy Your Product?"*
- [ ] For this customer do you have a STRONG ANSWER to *"Why Buy Now?"*
- [ ] For this customer, do you have a STRONG ANSWER as to how this demo will assist the TECHNICAL CHAMPION and EXECUTIVE BUYER?


## Choosing Work Flows
- [ ] 3 WHYS: Focus on work flows that address the 3 WHY's discussed in the PREP section
- [ ] KISS: Unless the customer can geek out on it, NEVER show work flows with complex steps. They are hard to follow and no matter what you think is the result, the customer will decide it is hard to use
- [ ] DEFENSIVE FUD: Integrate solutions to known competitor FUD in the demo. No need to address the competitor. This is done by unique work flows or even talking through your products methods under the hood
- [ ] PLACE LANDMINES: Use workflows that will hurt the competitor. No need to address the competitor. This is done by unique work flows or even talking through your products methods under the hood
- [ ] Use [Demomonkey](https://www.demomonkey.net/) to personalize the demo for the user


## Virtual Slides
- [ ] 20-30 SECONDS PER SLIDE: A few exceptions are allowed but should be rare. This is enough time to digest the slide but not too much time
- [ ] 7-10 MINUTES TOTAL: This amount of slides is best
- [ ] TRANSITION PAUSES: Seperate concepts with transition slides. Pause at these slides. Tease a promo about why they should listen to the next set of slides


## Right Before The First Screen
- [ ] PERSONALIZE IT: Start by a joke or a personal story
- [ ] CREATE DEMO STORY: Before showing the first screen, provide a high level story. Something that will tie every work flow and use-case together. *"Today we are going to play the role of an xyz engineer"* 
- [ ] LIFE CHANGING TEASE: State a life changing tease. Usually this includes a number. Something like "I am going to show you 3 clicks to ___"

## On the First Screen
- [ ] WOW THEM: Wow them in the first 3 seconds once the first screen is shown. Show something that will change their life before any word is said. Build this screen if you have to 
- [ ] BASK IN SHOCK: Bask in their shock. Do not assume they are seeing anything. Describe why this will change their life
- [ ] DEFINE FULL DEMO: Describe the different workflows you are about to show in a way that makes the customer excited to see them 


## For Longer Work Flow
- [ ] START BY TEASE: Start every workflow with a tease, why they should continue listening. Maybe a story, maybe a tease showing how their life is going to change due to this new workflow. Always be cognizant that they know why they should give an F about what you are currently doing and not just ignore it
- [ ] IS THIS LIFE CHANGING TEASE: If this workflow fulfilled the life changing tease described above, make sure that your tease states this. Always be cognizant that they know why they should give an F about what you are currently doing and not just ignore it
- [ ] - [ ] ONE THING: Keep the excitement of a flow. Almost always describe only ONE thing per screen transition. Sometimes 2 items are okay but this is rare. The exception to this rule is if you know that the customer will geek out on that screen and want to see a lot more
- [ ] BUTTON CLICKS: Before every major button click: 1) Say what you are about to do AND why they should care 2) Do it. 3) Then say what you just did. [Tell Show Tell](https://blog.2winglobal.com/perfecting-your-demonstration-techniques-the-tell-show-tell-method)
- [ ] REMINDERS IN LONG FLOWS: If it is a long work flow then constantly remind them what is the workflow. Always be cognizant that they know why they should give an F about what you are currently doing and not just ignore it
- [ ] FLOW SUMMARY: Exit the workflow making sure they know what they just saw and why. Tell-Show-Tell. Always be cognizant that they know why they should give an F about what you are currently doing and not just ignore it
- [ ] - [ ] IS THIS LIFE CHANGING TEASE: If this workflow fulfilled the life changing tease described above, make sure they know that they just saw it
- [ ] SPRINKLE BENEFITS: From the 3 Whys, constantly add reminders to those benefits described right before the first screen, in this workflow, and all 3 why benefits. Remember, they will not think about these, be obvious in telling them when to look for them
- [ ] PAUSE BY QUESTIONS: Ask for questions after a workflow, not during. "Any questions" is good enough. Personal questions directed at their use-case are better if possible


## For Shorter Work Flow
- [ ] START BY QUICK TEASE: Start every workflow with a tease, why they should continue listening. Maybe a story, maybe a tease showing how their life is going to change due to this new workflow. Always be cognizant that they know why they should give an F about what you are currently doing and not just ignore it
- [ ] - [ ] ONE THING: Keep the excitement of a flow. Almost always describe only ONE thing per screen transition. Sometimes 2 items are okay but this is rare. The exception to this rule is if you know that the customer will geek out on that screen and want to see a lot more
- [ ] BUTTON CLICKS: Before every major button click: 1) Say what you are about to do AND why they should care 2) Do it. 3) Then say what you just did. [Tell Show Tell](https://blog.2winglobal.com/perfecting-your-demonstration-techniques-the-tell-show-tell-method)

Remember, they will not think about these, be obvious in telling them when to look for them.

- [ ] - [ ] QUICK FLOW SUMMARY: Exit the workflow making sure they know what they just saw and why. Tell-Show-Tell




## Demo Ending
- [ ] SUMMARIZE DEMO: Summarize what you showed in a way that makes them remember why this is important to them


## Things to always remember
### Anti-Boat Harbor Tour

NEVER have the below statements be the main reason for someone to look at something new. They can be used as a secondary purpose for the transition. Secondary to the 'why the customer should care' statement:
- [ ] *we can click/go/see*
- [ ] *over here*

### How to improve the stories and make the message sound more powerful
1. Choose a demo and/or slide deck that you share a lot
2. Write out a 7 minute demo. Literally write it out. This helps you hone into the exact stories that are most impactful. Make it 7 minutes so that you have to be succinct while giving you enough time to share a lot of the product
3. Read this written-demo 15 times. Each time you will find that you improve it as you realize certain messages are not hitting as well as you thought. Always try to find new and better stories that hit the message best
4. Present it to your manager (me.) This is important as it adds extra pressure to all of the above activities

### Ummmmm
- [ ] PAUSE INSTEAD OF UM: Do not say *um* or any other thinking phrase. It is okay to wait until the next phrase comes to mind. This pause is actually beneficial for the demo
