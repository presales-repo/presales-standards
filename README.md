# presales-standards
There are a lot of great ideas in the presales world with very little standardization. Even the name of this role is not standardized (Presales Engineer, System Engineer, Solution Architect, Sales Engineer etc)

I wanted to create a repo to start to coordinate all of these great ideas. These ideas will continue to evolve which is why I am placing these on Github. If you feel that anything in this repo can be improved, please *please* *PLEASE* submit an issue. I would love to make these as solid as possible
