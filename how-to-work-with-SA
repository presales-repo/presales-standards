#  Travel for Individual Contributors
 - Expected travel is 25-30% unless told differently (Surges in travel are understandable as long as the cumulative stays around 25-30%)
 - Travel should only be expected by the assigned SA to the territory. Other SA's can volunteer but there is no expectation that they attend nor expect quota relief for those deals



# Overlay Solution Architects
 - All requests for overlay time from AE/SA's running a territory should go through the territories SA, not the AE. This includes overlays in the region and corporate level overlays
 - DoD Overlays are connected to RVP's in the same way as an SA is connected to AE. As in, the two of them build plans together to define the actions of the SA for that region

# Customer Meeting Expections
 - Shadow Notes are to be placed on the calendar at the same time as the meeting. If these shadow notes do not exist prior to the meeting then the SA is not required to attend the meeting 
 - Shadow Notes will have at least the following information:
 -- Expected audience (specifically if they are technical or executive etc)
 -- Goal of the meeting
 -- What demo is to be presented
 -- Any key pieces of information to keep in mind while presenting
 - Except an occasional and rare exception, AE's present the slide deck for all presentations
 - If an uncommon, custom demo is to be presented, the SA is allowed to define the amount of time necessary to create that demo

# Proof of Value (PoV)
 - Several prep meetings and informal approvals must be setup in advance of a PoV to acheive the below. These rules come from years of experience seeing failed PoCs/PoVs due to not preparing the customer in advance of the effort. If the below items cannot be met but a pilot needs to be built, then it is expected that the customer will perform a customer-led trial instead of a PoC
 -- A list of criteria that needs to be built in the PoV (the SA will assist in reducing this list down to a quickly delivered PoV)
 -- Verbal commitment from the economic buyer that, if proven, the above list of criteria would be enough for a purchase
 -- Customer assigns someone to assist the PoV effort. This is key, it needs to be a very capable engineer with the correct permissions/accesses to fulfill the task (not the engineer that has free time)
