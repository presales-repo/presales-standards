# Background
Why this is being written and where these facts are coming from


#  Travel for Individual Contributors
 * **25-30% Travel** Expected travel is 25-30% unless told differently (Surges in travel are understandable as long as the cumulative stays around 25-30%)
 * **In territory** Travel should only be expected by the assigned SA to the territory. Other SA's can volunteer but there is no expectation that they attend nor expect quota relief for those deals

# SA relationship with Support
One there is a purchase Support will provide Tier 1/2 Support. Initial help should come from Support

# Overlay Solution Architects
 * **SA's request Overlay Support** All requests for overlay time from AE/SA's running a territory should go through the territories SA, not the AE. This includes overlays in the region and corporate level overlays
 * **Work on this one** DoD Overlays are connected to RVP's in the same way as an SA is connected to AE. As in, the two of them build plans together to define the actions of the SA for that region

# Customer Meeting Expections
There are exceptions to these below rules but they are rare
 * **Shadow Notes Mandatory** This is specific to internally created meetings (customer did not create the meeting) At least 24 hours before the meeting, shadow Notes are to be placed on the calendar at the same timeslot as the meeting. If these shadow notes do not exist prior to the meeting then the SA is not required to attend the meeting. 
 * **Shadow Note Specs** Shadow Notes will have at least the following information:
    **add a shadow notes template**
    - Expected audience (specifically if they are technical or executive etc)
    - Goal of the meeting
    - What defines this as a successful meeting to you
    - What demo is to be presented
    - Any key pieces of information to keep in mind while presenting
 * **Default is: SA's don't share Elastic 101 slides** AE's present the fundamental slide deck for the 101 presentations. The SA can decide when if and if they present slides
 * **Custom Demo's take more time** If an uncommon, custom demo is to be presented, the SA is allowed to define the amount of time necessary to create that demo. The size/chance of the deal and quantity of custom demo's requested will affect the level of effort, if any, that will be considered to create the demo. The scope is heavily driven by the SA to avoid scope creep. It is not expected to be presented utnil that time is completed
 * **pre meeting**
 * **post meeting**
 * **create criteria for SDR created meeting** also, when we don't need to be on a meeting
 * **create criteria for overlapping meetings with different AE's**

# Proof of Value (PoV)
 * **Specs needed for PoV** Several prep meetings and informal approvals must be setup in advance of a PoV to acheive the below. These rules come from years of experience seeing failed PoVs due to not preparing the customer in advance of the effort. If the below items cannot be met but a pilot needs to be built, then it is expected that the customer will perform a customer-led trial instead of a PoV. Custom demos/POVs should ONLY be performed on the criteria that canâ€™t be shown via **existing demos or customer references**
    - A list of success criteria created with the customer that needs to be built in the PoV (the SA will assist in reducing this list down to a quickly delivered PoV)
    - Verbal commitment from the economic buyer that, if proven, the above list of criteria will be enough from a technical perspective would be enough for a purchase
    - Customer assigns someone to assist the PoV effort. This is key, it needs to be a very capable engineer with the correct permissions/accesses to fulfill the task (not the engineer that has free time)
    - Paid pilots should be the preferred option for any custom POC/POV/demo (less OOTB features, maybe for the 2nd/3rd deal) that will take more than X specified amount of time. Paid Pilots should engage Services
    - **Reduce customization. This needs to be as cookie cutter as possible. We cannot maintain this**
